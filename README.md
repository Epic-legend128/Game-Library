## Games Included
The games which are included within this webpage are quite simple. They were all made with Unity and are 2d games.
### Snake
Regular snake game in which you have to move your character around the screen without hitting the walls or your body. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible because they provide you with 1 point each but also increase your body size making it harder and harder to remain in the game without hitting your own body.

### Minesweeper
This game is similar to the classic Minesweeper. So basically your goal is to open all of the boxes presented to you on the screen while avoiding clicking on any bombs. Every time you click on a box it will tell you the amount of mines around it. This game has a couple of different preset dimensions and amount of bombs to select from to play but you can also create your own custom game with a specific width, height and number of bombs.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
This is played just like the regular tic-tac-toe game in which you have to place 3 of your symbols consecutively either in a row, column or diagonal. The board size is always 3 by 3 and you are able to play against another player locally or against an AI.

### Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird is an interesting game in which you have to press the spacebar in order to make your character jump in the air while avoiding to hit any obstacles(pipes) coming your way. Every time you pass in between 2 pipes you get a point.

### Chess
Chess is a classical board game in which you have 8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 1 queen and 1 king. The board is 8X8 and it is played locally against a second person. The rules are way too many to list here so if you are interested in knowing all of the game's rules then visit the [FIDE rules of chess](https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf).
